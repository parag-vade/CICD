Point-wise breakdown of above DevOps CI/CD pipeline diagram:

1. Source Code (Git Repository):

2. Developers commit code changes to the source code repository (likely Git).
Webhook Trigger:

A webhook is triggered when new changes are pushed to the repository, notifying Jenkins to start the build process.
Jenkins:

Jenkins, a continuous integration tool, initiates the pipeline by pulling the latest source code from the repository.
Maven:

Jenkins uses Maven to build the project. If the Maven build is successful, the pipeline proceeds.
Yes: If the Maven build is successful, the process continues to SonarQube.
No: If the Maven build fails, the pipeline exits, generating a report that is sent via Slack/email.
SonarQube (Code Quality Analysis):

SonarQube checks the code for quality issues (like bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells).
Yes: If the code passes quality checks, it moves to the testing phase.
No: If the code fails quality checks, the pipeline exits, and a report is sent.
Automated Tests:

If both the Maven build and SonarQube checks are successful, automated tests are run.
Yes: If the tests pass, the process continues.
No: The pipeline exits, and a report is sent.
Docker Image Creation:

A new Docker image is created with the updated code and pushed to DockerHub.
Image Updater:

A process (Image Updater) detects the new image in DockerHub and updates the image in the Manifests Repo.
Argo CD:

Argo CD, a continuous deployment tool, pulls the new image from the Manifests Repo and updates the running Kubernetes cluster with the new deployment.
Notifications:

At various failure points, notifications are sent via Slack, email, or other tools integrated into the pipeline.
This pipeline automates the entire process from code commits to deployment on a Kubernetes cluster with thorough quality checks and continuous integration/deployment.
